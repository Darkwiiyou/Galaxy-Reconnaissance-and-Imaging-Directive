 
The Galaxy-Reconnaissance-and-Imaging-Directive (GRID) is a comprehensive data collection initiative focused on gathering information about the Starbase's Space System. Central to GRID's efforts is the study of the Gas Giant "EOS" and its diverse array of moons, each with its unique characteristics.

The moons orbiting EOS include Chemosh, Elysium, Szellem, Kumi, Albedo, Mare, Alstel, Masser, Neso, Caecus, Amethyst, Aurora, Tartarus, Kypselis, Magellan, Iris, Ciel, and Szalonna. These celestial bodies are further characterized by their submoons, such as Vilous (Submoon of Ciel), Cassini (Submoon of Ciel), Mel (Submoon of Kypselis), Tephra (Submoon of Tartarus), Ferrum (Submoon of Amethyst), Mures (Submoon of Caecus), Lone (Submoon of Neso), Secunda (Submoon of Messar), Aura (Submoon of Mare), Xevaos (Submoon of Kumi), Anamllaan (Submoon of Kumi), Suti (Submoon of Szellam), Sugon (Submoon of Chemosh).

GRID employs various data collection methods, utilizing Capital ships and Origin Stations as reference points to enhance the precision of information gathering. Additionally, miscellaneous data collecting methods are employed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the Starbase's Space System. The initiative aims to provide valuable insights into the characteristics, composition, and dynamics of the EOS Gas Giant and its associated moons, contributing to the broader understanding of the galactic environment.
